# Random-Forest-and-Decision-Tree
For this project I explored publicly available data Lending Club. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). I created a model that will help classify non-payers and payers.

The graph below shows the purpose of taking loan and the count of people who have fully paid and not fully paid. The proportion of fully paid to not fully paid looks similar in almost all the cases.
